# UnityThirdPersonCharacterController
A Third-Person Character Controller for Unity 3D using Unity's built-in CharacterController

These are the scripts I wrote for my Third-Person Character Controller in Unity.
To get it working in your project you'll need to rename the Animator Strings and other elements in the Player State Machine to fit your project's Animations, Animator, Avatar, or Character Model.

The code has been written using a variety of sources so I gratefully give credit below:

-This YouTube channel was a great resource to focus on using Unity's built-in CharacterController. Using the foundations of this channel I was able to create my own State Machine to work for the things I needed.

Ledge Grabbing and climbing was the hardest thing to program but MinionsArt's tutorial was perfect. I was able to customize it to fit my other scripts.
